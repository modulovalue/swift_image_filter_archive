# swift_image_filter_archive

(2015)
I wanted to achieve two things with my iPhone.

1. Create a camera application that read sensor data and used that to control various filter parameters (it wasn't as pretty as expected)
2. Create an application for taking timelapses at night but that wasn't possible back then. Apple didn't allow slower shutter speeds than 1/2.
